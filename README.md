Version Control: Track changes made to test cases, view revision history, and revert to previous versions if necessary.
2. Test Plan Creation and Execution:
Test Planning: Plan test cycles, assign test cases to testers, and set priorities for testing activities.
Execution: Execute test cases, record results, and track progress in real-time.
3. Defect Tracking:
Capture Defects: Report and track defects found during testing, including details such as severity, priority, and status.
Integration with Issue Tracking Systems: Integrate with popular issue tracking systems like JIRA, Bugzilla, or GitHub Issues for seamless defect management.
4. Requirement Traceability:
Link Test Cases to Requirements: Establish traceability between test cases and corresponding requirements to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
Requirements Management: Manage requirements within the system, track changes, and link them to related test artifacts.
5. Reporting and Analytics:
Custom Reports: Generate custom reports to analyze testing progress, defect trends, and overall project quality.
Dashboards: Visualize testing metrics through interactive dashboards for better decision-making.
6. Collaboration and Integration:
Team Collaboration: Facilitate collaboration among team members through discussion forums, comments, and notifications.
Integration with CI/CD Pipelines: Integrate with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing workflows and trigger tests with each code change.
